Hi !

This is a textual pokemon game focused on battle. It is based on a mix between gen 1 and 2 battle mechanics. I removed some broken stuff such as Bind.

The goal is simple : beat your opponent ! You choose your team, the IA chooses his and you (hopefully) win the battle. 

Feel free to share and modify the game if you like it. I am also available if you encounter bugs or if you have any good ideas !
